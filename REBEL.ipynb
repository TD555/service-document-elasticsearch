It is an important branch in biology because heredity is vital to organisms\\' evolution. Gregor Mendel, a Moravian Augustinian friar working in the 19th century in Brno, was the first to study genetics scientifically. Mendel studied \"trait inheritance\", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring over time. He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete \"units of inheritance\". This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene.\\nTrait inheritance and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century, but modern genetics has expanded to study the function and behavior of genes. Gene structure and function, variation, and distribution are studied within the context of the cell, the organism (e.g. dominance), and within the context of a population. Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields, including molecular genetics, epigenetics and population genetics. Organisms studied within the broad field span the domains of life (archaea, bacteria, and eukarya).\\nGenetic processes work in combination with an organism\\'s environment and experiences to influence development and behavior, often referred to as nature versus nurture. The intracellular or extracellular environment of a living cell or organism may increase or decrease gene transcription. A classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn, one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate (lacking sufficient waterfall or rain). While the average height of the two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal, the one in the arid climate only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment.'})\n",

In 1953 Francis Crick, James Watson, Rosalind Franklin, and colleagues working at the Medical Research Council Unit, Cavendish Laboratory, created the double helix model of DNA. They proposed the DNA structure based on previous research done by Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. This led to the discovery of DNA material in other microorganisms, plants, and animals.The field of molecular biology includes techniques which enable scientists to learn about molecular processes. These techniques are be used to efficiently target new drugs, diagnose disease, and better understand cell physiology. Some clinical research and medical therapies arising from molecular biology are covered under gene therapy whereas the use of molecular biology or molecular cell biology in medicine is now referred to as molecular medicine.\\n\\n'})\n",

Probably this is due to widespread adoption of the techniques of both disciplines by all biologists. However, historically molecular biology emerged from a convergence between biochemistry and genetics. Biochemistry is centred in chemistry and principally deals with understanding the function of proteins. Genetics is principally concerned with the function of genes and inheritance. Molecular biology emerged later, once the molecular mechanisms (biochemistry) of gene function were determined, and focuses on the relationship between genes and functional gene products (which are in most cases proteins). So molecular biology could be viewed as the nexus between biochemistry and genetics\n",
